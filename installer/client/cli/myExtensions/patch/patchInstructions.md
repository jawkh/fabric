Create a Patch File
Alternatively, you can create a patch file containing your changes. 

- Apply this patch in your Dockerfile or entrypoint script:

1. Modify Dockerfile:

- Copy the modified file into the container, create a patch and apply it during the build process:
``` Dockerfile
Copy code FROM python:3.10-slim

# Install the package
RUN pip install pymupdf4llm

# Copy modified file into the contain
COPY pymupdf_rag_modified.py /pymupdf_rag_modified.py

# Generate the patch file
diff -u ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pymupdf4llm/helpers/pymupdf_rag.py /pymupdf_rag_modified.py > pymupdf_rag_modified.patch

# Apply the patch file
RUN patch /path/to/pymupdf_rag.py /pymupdf_rag_modified.patch -b
```

# Continue with the rest of the Dockerfile
This approach is useful if you only need to make minor changes and donâ€™t want to maintain a full fork of the repository.
